# Digital Clock

A simple digital clock web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The clock displays the current time and updates every second.

## Features

- Displays the current time in **HH:MM:SS** format.
- Displays date and timezone in different formats
- Automatically updates every second.
- Simple and clean user interface.
- Responsive design to work across different screen sizes.

## Design Overview

In this project I worked with **HTML elements** and targeting the **DOM** utilizing **vanilla JavaScript**. Utilizing the built in methods within the language, I was able to write a simple yet clean clock app. Then, to add styling and responsive design, I added **CSS** to the page. A simple app that focuses on the fundementals of writing clean code.

## Demo

You can view the clock in action by opening the `index.html` file in your browser.
